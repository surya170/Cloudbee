# Train Ticket Management System

## Overview:

The Train Ticket Management System is a simple Spring Boot application designed to manage train tickets. It adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and employs a layered structure, including a service layer (`TrainTicketService`), a repository layer (`UserRepository`), and a controller layer (`TrainTicketController`).

## Setup:

### Prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven build tool installed

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/train-ticket-management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd train-ticket-management
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The Spring Boot application will start, and you should see log messages indicating that the application is running.

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open a Postman and go to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:8080) to access the Train Ticket Management System.

## Interactions:

1. **User Makes a Purchase (API Endpoint: /api/tickets/purchase):**
   - The user sends a purchase request to the `purchaseTicket` API of `TrainTicketController`.
   - The controller delegates the request to the `purchaseTicket` method in `TrainTicketService`.
   - The service allocates a seat, creates a `User` object, saves it using the `UserRepository`, and returns a `Receipt`.

2. **Viewing Users (API Endpoint: /api/tickets/users):**
   - The user sends a request to the `viewUsers` API of `TrainTicketController`.
   - The controller delegates the request to the `viewUsers` method in `TrainTicketService`.
   - The service retrieves the list of users from the `UserRepository` and returns it.

3. **Removing a User (API Endpoint: /api/tickets/remove/{userName}):**
   - The user sends a request to the `removeUser` API of `TrainTicketController` with a specific username.
   - The controller delegates the request to the `removeUser` method in `TrainTicketService`.
   - The service removes the user with the given username using the `UserRepository`.

4. **Modifying a User's Seat (API Endpoint: /api/tickets/modifySeat/{userName}/{newSeat}):**
   - The user sends a request to the `modifySeat` API of `TrainTicketController` with a specific username and a new seat.
   - The controller delegates the request to the `modifySeat` method in `TrainTicketService`.
   - The service updates the user's seat using the `UserRepository`.

For detailed instructions on API usage and further details, please refer to the codebase and the respective JavaDoc documentation within the classes.
